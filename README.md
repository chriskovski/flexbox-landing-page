# Landing Page
I created a "Avengers"-themed Landing Page, including a Header & Footer, a Hero-Section, some Content and a Call-to-Action field.

# Description
This was an exercise following the "The Odin Project"-Path in becoming a web developer.

This is my first Project as a aspiring web developer. I made a Landing Page usind HTML & CSS (more explicitly Flexbox). I had the structure of the page mostly layed out already, but I still like the Outcome of this Project. The Links are not clickable, as this is a example Landing Page.

I didn't have had that much of a problem with this exercise, but I still had some challenges in adding the pictures (especially so you can see them in the preview). Flexbox was pretty straight forward, but I need to get used with placing stuff and making things responsive.
